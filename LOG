Problem         On Your Own?    Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1               no              forgot that putting a:b matches b to an array not an element, use recusrsion stupid

2               yes             used reucrsion like the last one, but the terminating case has two elements

3               partial         didn't handle index bounds. Use recursion as a way to whittle down an array, counting each iteration

4               yes             solved two ways - just a wrapper for length. recursively added up each element

5               partial         first way on own, second way with more efficient list concat on own

6               yes             solved on my own, wrote my own list equality method for practice, used style suggestion from hlint
