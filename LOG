Problem         On Your Own?    Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1               no              forgot that putting a:b matches b to an array not an element, use recusrsion stupid

2               yes             used reucrsion like the last one, but the terminating case has two elements

3               part            didn't handle index bounds. Use recursion as a way to whittle down an array, counting each iteration
